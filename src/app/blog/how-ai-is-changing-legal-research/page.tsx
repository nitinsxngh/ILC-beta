          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Shift from Manual to Automated Research</h2>
          <p>
            Legal research has traditionally involved extensive manual review of statutes, case law, legal journals, and other sources to find relevant precedent and legal principles.
            This process can take hours or even days, depending on the complexity of the issue. However, AI-powered legal research tools are changing this paradigm:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong> AI utilizes NLP to understand and interpret legal language, allowing users to input queries in plain language rather than legal jargon.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Predictive Analytics:</strong> AI systems can analyze vast amounts of legal data to predict outcomes based on historical case law, helping lawyers assess the viability of their cases more accurately.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Document Analysis:</strong> AI tools can quickly sift through thousands of documents, identifying relevant information and extracting important case citations or legal provisions.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section className="mb-8 text-justify">
